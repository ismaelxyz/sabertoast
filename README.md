# Saber Toast

I was doing a project without node js and I found the need to create toast, to show temporary messages that the user can read and help him to interact with the program. I hope you find it useful.

## Uso

Just insert the saber-toast.css and saber-toast.js files into your html and then configure when you want a popup message to appear. The index.html file is a good example of use.
